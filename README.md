This repository contains a simple Node.js server script that fetches the latest stories from Time.com upon a specific request. The server responds to `GET` requests to `/getTimeStories` endpoint, parsing and returning the titles and links of the latest stories in a JSON format.

To run the server, ensure you have Node.js installed, then execute `node server.js`. The server will start running on `http://localhost:4000`.
